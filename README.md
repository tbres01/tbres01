## Introduction
I am an IT Analyst and cybersecurity student with hands-on experience building security labs focused on detection, monitoring, and incident response. I have a strong foundation in networking, system administration, and security operations, with a passion for understanding how attacks occur and how to detect and respond to them effectively in real-world environments.

---

## Objective
My goal is to continue transitioning deeper into cybersecurity by developing practical, demonstrable skills aligned with Security Operations Center (SOC) and defensive security roles. Through hands-on labs, I focus on log analysis, threat detection, endpoint visibility, and incident response workflows that mirror real enterprise environments.

---

## Project Objective
This Detection Lab project was designed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus is ingesting and analyzing logs within Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms while generating realistic telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This lab strengthens my understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies used by SOC teams.

## Skills Learned
- SIEM deployment, configuration, and log analysis  
- Network traffic analysis and attack detection  
- Endpoint monitoring and host-based visibility  
- Incident response fundamentals and alert triage  
- Understanding of attacker techniques and telemetry generation  
- Log correlation, pattern recognition, and investigation workflows  
- Practical experience with Windows, Linux, and Active Directory environments  
- Troubleshooting networking, DNS, DHCP, and authentication issues
